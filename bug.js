```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500">
  </div>
```
This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS's gradient feature. However, if the `from` and `to` colors are too similar, the gradient might not be visible, resulting in a subtle bug where the background appears solid instead of a gradient.
